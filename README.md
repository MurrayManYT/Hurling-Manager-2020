# Hurling-Manager-2020
Right then, hello all. This is the READ ME for Gaelic Games Manager: Football 2020 and is pretty important so please pay attention.

If a prompt gives you an option to type in certain words. Please make sure you spell it correctly as to not mess with the decision making.
Your device MUST have Python installed to use the game as it is a Python Script.
Be sure to read instructions and prompts before typing, this will help avoid unnecessary mistakes from happening or the game being prematurely ended.
If you get the option to use the 'train' command, use it before simulating.

That's all for the Instructions, etc. if I think of anything else, I will add it.
And finally, if you have any questions then DM me on Discord at Murray Man#5493 or join my Discord server for real-time support https://discord.gg/8DUSA66
Enjoy the game.
